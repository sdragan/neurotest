			Make dots not overlap with each other:
			1. Build a grid with a cell size depending on dots amount (more dots - less the size of cells);
			2. Put dots in randomly selected cells with some random distance from its center (distance < cell.size/2);

			Connect dots "not too randomly":
			3. Start with a dot closest to the border;
			4. Use line intersection algorithm to interact through every other free dots to search for a shortest possible non-intersecting path;
			5. If there's no path available - choose any free dot and draw a line to it.
